# Apache Solr (Built with Ansible Container)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/geerlingguy/solr-container.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/geerlingguy/solr-container) [![](https://images.microbadger.com/badges/image/geerlingguy/solr.svg)](https://microbadger.com/images/geerlingguy/solr "Get your own image badge on microbadger.com")

This project is composed of three main parts:

  - **Ansible Container project**: This project is maintained on GitHub: [geerlingguy/solr-container](https://github.com/geerlingguy/solr-container). Please file issues, support requests, etc. against this GitHub repository.
  - **Docker Hub Image**: If you just want to use [the `geerlingguy/solr` Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/geerlingguy/solr/) in your project, you can pull it from Docker Hub.
  - **Ansible Role**: If you need a flexible Ansible role that's compatible with both traditional servers and containerized builds, check out [`geerlingguy.solr`](https://galaxy.ansible.com/geerlingguy/solr/) on Ansible Galaxy. (This is the Ansible role that does the bulk of the work in managing the Apache Solr container.)

## Versions

Currently maintained versions include:

  - `7.x`, `7.1.0`, `latest`: Apache Solr 7.x
  - `6.x`, `6.6.2`: Apache Solr 6.x
  - `5.x`, `5.5.5`: Apache Solr 5.x
  - `4.x`, `4.10.4`: Apache Solr 4.x
  - `3.x`, `3.6.2`: Apache Solr 3.x

## Standalone Usage

If you want to use the `geerlingguy/solr` image from Docker Hub, you don't need to install or use this project at all. You can quickly build a Solr container locally with:

    docker run -d --name=solr -p 8983:8983 geerlingguy/solr:latest /opt/solr/bin/solr start -p 8983 -s /var/solr -f -force

(For Solr 4.x, drop the final `-force` argument.)

You can also wrap up that configuration in a `Dockerfile` and/or a `docker-compose.yml` file if you want to keep things simple. For example:

    ```
    version: "3"
    
    services:
      solr:
        image: geerlingguy/solr:latest
        container_name: solr
        ports:
          - "8983:8983"
        restart: always
        # See 'Custom and Persistent Solr cores' for instructions for volumes.
        volumes: []
        command: ["/opt/solr/bin/solr", "start", "-p", "8983", "-s", "/var/solr", "-f", "-force"]

Then run:

    docker-compose up -d

Now you should be able to access the Solr admin dashboard at `http://localhost:8983/`.

### Custom and Persistent Solr cores

The default installation includes a `collection1` core in the `SOLR_HOME` directory, `/var/solr`.

Apache Solr will autodiscover any Solr cores in `SOLR_HOME` by searching for `core.properties` files inside each subdirectory. A standard convention for a single Solr core is to to mount a host directory as a volume with the core directory, containing the core's `conf`, `data`, and `core.properties` files.

Here's an example minimal `core.properties` file, for a core named `mysearch`:

    name=mysearch
    config=solrconfig.xml
    schema=schema.xml
    dataDir=data

So, if you have a solr core directory named `mysearch` (with a `mysearch/core.properties` file inside, and a `conf` and `data` directory for storing Solr configuration and index data, respectively), which looks like this:
    
    mysearch_conf/
    ├── conf
    │   ├── elevate.xml
    │   ├── mapping-ISOLatin1Accent.txt
    │   ├── protwords.txt
    │   ├── _rest_managed.json
    │   ├── schema_extra_fields.xml
    │   ├── schema_extra_types.xml
    │   ├── schema.xml
    │   ├── solrconfig_extra.xml
    │   ├── solrconfig.xml
    │   ├── solrcore.properties
    │   ├── stopwords.txt
    │   └── synonyms.txt
    ├── core.properties
    └── data 
 
Mount it as a volume like `-v ./mysearch:/var/solr/mysearch:rw`. If you have multiple solr cores (all defined inside a `cores` directory), mount them inside a `cores` directory like `-v ./cores:/var/solr/cores`.

Or, if using a Docker Compose file:

    services:
      solr:
        ...
        volumes:
          # If you have one core:
          - ./mysearch:/var/solr/mysearch:rw
          # If you have multiple cores:
          - ./cores:/var/solr/cores:rw

You can also mount volumes from a data container or elsewhere; the key is you will be able to both provide custom Solr configuration (`schema.xml`, `solrconfig.xml`, etc.), and also have a persistent `data` directory that lives outside the container.

### Apache Solr 3.x

There are a number of differences to keep in mind if using Apache Solr 3.x:

  - Apache Solr 3.x doesn't support `core.properties` or core autodiscovery, so if you want to use a custom Solr core configuration, you should mount a volume into `/opt/solr/example/solr` with your Solr core configuration (`conf` and `data` dirs, at minimum).
  - At this time, multicore isn't officially supported under 3.x in this Docker container.
  - Apache Solr 3.x doesn't run in the foreground in the same way as 4+. You have to use the `command` `java -jar start.jar` inside the directory `/opt/solr/example` to start Solr in the foreground.

## Management with Ansible Container

### Prerequisites

Before using this project to build and maintain a Solr images for Docker, you need to have the following installed:

  - [Docker Community Edition](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) (for Mac, Windows, or Linux)
  - [Ansible Container](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-container/installation.html)

### Build the image

    ansible-container --var-file vars-7.x.yml build

Once the image is built, you can run `docker images` to see the `acsolr-solr` image that was generated.

Older Solr versions are also supported—specify the vars file for the version you would like to install to switch to that version of Solr.

### Run the image as a container

    ansible-container --var-file vars-7.x.yml run

You should be able to reach the Solr dashboard by accessing [http://localhost:8983/](http://localhost:8983/) in your browser.

(Use `stop` to stop the container, and `destroy` to reset the containers and _all_ images.)

### Push the image to Docker Hub

Currently, the process for updating this image on Docker Hub is manual. Eventually this will be automated via Travis CI using `ansible-container push` (currently, this is waiting on [this issue](https://github.com/ansible/ansible-container/issues/630) to be resolved).

  1. Log into Docker Hub on the command line:

         docker login --username=geerlingguy

  1. Tag the latest version (only if this is the latest/default version):

         docker tag [image id] geerlingguy/solr:latest

  1. Tag the Solr major version:

         docker tag [image id] geerlingguy/solr:7.x # or 6.x, 5.x, 4.x, 3.x...
         docker tag [image id] geerlingguy/solr:7.1.0 # the specific version

  1. Push tags to Docker Hub:

         docker push geerlingguy/solr:latest # (if this was just tagged)
         docker push geerlingguy/solr:7.x # or 6.x, 5.x, 4.x, 3.x...
         docker push geerlingguy/solr:7.1.0 # the specific version
